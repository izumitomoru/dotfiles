# nvim config
All my nvim config files.
I'm addicted to configuring things.

Originally I was just planning on getting a quick editor set up so I could focus on relearning C++, but I've spent genuinely somewhere around 30 - 40 hours in the past week or so just having fun on this, and well, it's almost done now, I'm almost free.
